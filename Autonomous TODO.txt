read the distance sensor
adjust the up/down variable to compensate for any distance changes

the distance sensor should be kept at ~ 41


Pseudo code:

get initial value
start loop
	if current value != initial value && reached wood is false
		make reached wood true
	if reached wood
		adjust distance from wood according to sensor
