The samantha module has been having some connection issues.
The connection is dropped, and the robot continues following its last command, regardless of any new ones.

We thought that it was either:
1. the code
2. the laptop

I looked it up here (http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robotics_Programs/FTC/FTC_Documents/FCS_User_Guide_For_Teams.pdf).
The that we are connecting is through WAN (wireless area network), not LAN (local area network).
In other words, we shouldn't be connecting to the robot directly from the robot, but rather we should be connecting the laptop to a router, then the router to the robot.

I think that we should get a router (and a network cable) and try to get the robot to connect to that.
