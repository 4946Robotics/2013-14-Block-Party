To do
=====

[COMPLETED] Email all programmers
[COMPLETED] Add all programmers to organization
[NOT STARTED] Ensure that all of next years programmers can do everything

[COMPLETED] Fix/Decrease lag
	[COMPLETED] Test lag in program
	[COMPLETED] Obtain router

[ABORTED] Research math behind Vector drive
	[ABORTED] Translation
	[ABORTED] Rotation

[IN PROGRESS] Notes
	[COMPLETED] Add method for creating the ad hoc network to notes

[WORKING, MAKING NEW VER] Omni drive
	[COMPLETED] Translation
	[COMPLETED] Rotation
	[COMPLETED] Program it
	[COMPLETED] Make the code somewhat understandable
	[COMPLETED] Implement code that uses trigonometry to calculate wheel speeds
	[NOT STARTED] Look at values printing on NXT to determine if scaling or trimming of TrigDrive is needed
	[IN PROGRESS] Add other code to TrigDriv branch so it can be used normally
	[NOT STARTED] Compare drive-ablity of two teleop controls
	[NOT STARTED] Merge / abandon TrigDrive branch

[CAN PLACE BLOCKS] Autonomous
	[IN PROGRESS] Reverse left/right direction if distance sensor reads a big jump (prevent driving off forever)
	[NOT STARTED] Add code to make robot drive onto ramp after placing block
	[NOT STARTED] Reduce delays in block placing code (squeeze out more time for driving onto ramp)
	
[NOT STARTED] Scrimmage
	[NOT STARTED] Make sure that the robot is running the omni1 teleop code until trig drive is complete
	[NOT STARTED] Add non-driving functions to TrigDrive and upload to robot
	[NOT STARTED] Ask about the flag raiser (or are we not going to bother with it during the scrimmage?)
	[NOT STARTED] Gather stats on other robots (check the form)
	[NOT STARTED] Make sure robot is using latest autonomous code
	[NOT STARTED] Merge ZoomInAutonomous and TrigDrive into master branch
