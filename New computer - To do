Things that we need to do with the new computer:

1.  Request admin privileges (we need to be able to install software)
2.  Install the Field Control System (http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robotics_Programs/FTC/FTC_Documents/SamoV306.exe)
3.  Install the Github application (http://windows.github.com)
4.  Install the LVLM FTC Toolkit (https://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-17997)
5.  Make sure that we have any neccessary software for a bluetooth dongle
6.  Make sure that we have the rights to change the network for the field control system
        Note: check if we can do this already
