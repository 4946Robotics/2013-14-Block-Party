Things that we need to do with the new computer:

1. Request admin privileges (we need to be able to install software)
2. Install the field control system (http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robotics_Programs/FTC/FTC_Documents/SamoV306.exe)
3. Install the github application (http://windows.github.com)
4. Install the LVLM FTC Toolkit (required for LVLM users) (https://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-17997)
5. Get a bluetooth dongle (ask them if there is any software that needs to be installed)
6. Make sure that we have the rights to change the network for the field control system
