To do
=====
1. Determine correct method for rotating via changing the wheel speeds


General Information
===================

Convert the thumbstick position to polar coordinates (rather than x,y; use an angle and a distance [magnitude])
Remember, pi = 180 degrees
Use "halo controls" (translating with the left thumbstick, rotating with x of the right thumbstick)
Thumbstick output for 1 axis is in range [-128, 128]
Motor speed range is [-100, 100]


Translation
===========

x = x input from left thumbstick [-128, 128]
y = y input from left thumbstick [-128, 128]
rot = rotation of all wheels, in radians
mag = speed of all wheels
maxPowerToMotor = max speed of a motor (100)

if x == 0
	if y > 0
		rot = pi/2
	else if y < 0
		rot = 3pi/2
else
  rot = atan(y/x)
mag = maxPowerToMotor * sqrt( x^2 + y^2 ) / 128


Rotation
========

Right thumbstick left = -90 degrees, right thumbstick right = 90 degrees:
	rot = pi/2 * input/128


Also keep in mind
===========

Use event loops to handle rotating wheels to correct angle(s) and to correct speed(s)
Have an emergency tank drive button in case something fails (or you want to use tank drive)
